## The Why

**Impedance is not a number. It is a feeling.**

Traditional engineering tools are static. They are disconnected from reality. We believed there was a better way to visualize the invisible.

Luminous Harmonics is not a chart. It is a physics-based instrument.

We replaced static data points with a custom Spring Dynamics Engine. It allows you to feel the resistance. It lets you experience the magnetic snap of a 50Ω match. It transforms the Smith Chart from a terrifying grid into a fluid, explorable space.

## The Technology

We rejected the plastic feel of modern web frameworks. We built a custom render loop. It runs at 60fps. It is latency-free.

### Invisible Physics Engine
Instead of linear animations, we implemented a custom physics kernel.

* **Spring Dynamics.** The active point reacts to your cursor with mass and damping.
* **Magnetic Snap.** A custom gravity field around the 50Ω center point provides haptic-visual feedback upon matching.
* **Kalman Prediction.** Input coordinates are predicted to eliminate cursor lag during high-speed drags.

### Deep Dark Rendering
A bespoke aesthetic system designed to reduce eye strain. It feels like high-end avionics equipment.

* **Warm Charcoal.** We use #050505. Not pure black.
* **Electric Gold.** High contrast accents for active signal paths.
* **Film Grain.** A subtle SVG noise overlay removes digital coldness.
* **Zero-Allocation.** Canvas rendering logic is optimized to reuse object references. No frame drops.
